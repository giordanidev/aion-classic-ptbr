	<Text label="KEIDIAN00">It should be safe now, since we came this far.</Text>
	<Text label="REAL01">Thank you. I would&apos;ve been in big trouble if it weren&apos;t for you men.</Text>
	<Text label="KEIDIAN02">But Lord Mikael Rheal, I have something to tell you.</Text>
	<Text label="REAL03">... What is it?</Text>
	<Text label="KEIDIAN04">It wasn&apos;t a coincidence that the Trolls attacked you.</Text>
	<Text label="REAL05">... You mean those Trolls were waiting for me?</Text>
	<Text label="KEIDIAN06">That&apos;s it. And the person who plotted it was... Jurid Jeridise.</Text>
	<Text label="REAL07">What did you say!? My big brother did this?</Text>
	<Text label="KEIDIAN08">Yes. He almost got me and [%username] too, but we managed to survive.</Text>
	<Text label="REAL09">My big brother would do something like that...? I can&apos;t believe this tale.</Text>
	<Text label="KEIDIAN10">Please remember how they withdrew first from the hunting ground!</Text>
	<Text label="REAL11A">But, brother told me he wasn&apos;t feeling too well...</Text>
	<Text label="REAL11B">... You mean...?!</Text>
	<Text label="KEIDIAN12">It was all planned. I obtained information that a certain drug has entered Juhdenil from Tijerid, and I followed its path.</Text>
	<Text label="KEIDIAN13">While searching for its traces, one of our agents confirmed that the item has ended up with Jurid.</Text>
	<Text label="KEIDIAN14">That agent was discovered by Jurid, but sent me a note though this fellow to let me know what happened.</Text>
	<Text label="REAL15">A drug...?</Text>
	<Text label="KEIDIAN16">I don&apos;t know exactly what it is made of, but it seems that monsters injected with it turn extremely violent and also become several times stronger.</Text>
	<Text label="REAL17">So is that how it happened... ....Eh!?... My, my body...</Text>
	<Text label="KEIDIAN18">Lord Rheal!!</Text>
	<Text label="KEIDIAN19">[%username], I will return first to the castle with Lord Rheal!</Text>
