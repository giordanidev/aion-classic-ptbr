	<Text label="P02">When one of your group members tells the Recordkeeper of your intention to enter,</Text>
	<Text label="P03">your opponent will be summoned, and your training will begin.</Text>
	<Text label="P04">If you are defeated during training, you must wait in the Ready Room....</Text>
	<Text label="P05">until the rest of your comrades finish their training.</Text>
	<Text label="P06">You may rejoin the fight by giving a Worthiness Ticket to an Arbiter.</Text>
	<Text label="P07">Your training will continue until no one from your group is left standing.</Text>
