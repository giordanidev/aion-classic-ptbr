	<Text label="GARAS00">Kotia! I&apos;m here for the food again, today.</Text>
	<Text label="KOTIA01">Yes, here it is... But, how long are you going to continue doing this?</Text>
	<Text label="GARAS02">I&apos;m sorry to worry you... But my hands are tied.</Text>
	<Text label="KOTIA03">. . . . . .</Text>
	<Text label="GARAS04">Well... I will come again next time. Thank you.</Text>
	<Text label="GARAS05">Karu! Sorry to make you waiting. You must be hungry... Hurry and eat.</Text>
	<Text label="GARAS06">You poor little thing. You are just like me, a lonely orphan...</Text>
	<Text label="GARAS07">But don&apos;t worry, I&apos;ll always be by your side, protecting you...</Text>
	<Text label="GARAS08">Who... Who are you?! Are you here to take me away?</Text>
	<Text label="SOL09">What is the name of that little fellow?</Text>
	<Text label="GARAS10">His name is Karu. He is a lost orphan like me, and I&apos;ve been taking care of him.</Text>
	<Text label="KOTIA11">Garis... Why don&apos;t you give yourself up now?</Text>
	<Text label="GARAS12">He will die of hunger if I just leave him here. And I can&apos;t take him with me to the barracks, either...</Text>
	<Text label="GARAS13">So I must stay here and protect him!</Text>
	<Text label="KOTIA14">But, you can&apos;t be on the run forever, right? Think of your future!</Text>
	<Text label="GARAS15">But, it&apos;s too late now. Even if I was to return now...</Text>
	<Text label="KOTIA16">Actually... I already reported about you to Commander Keyhawk.</Text>
	<Text label="GARAS17">......!?</Text>
	<Text label="KOTIA18">He was angry at first, but he said he&apos;ll look the other way as long as you keep him hidden from other people.</Text>
	<Text label="GARAS19">Is... is that really true?</Text>
	<Text label="KOTIA20">Yes. So, let&apos;s go back to the unit.</Text>
	<Text label="GARAS20A">Thank you, Kotia... Sniff sniff...</Text>
	<Text label="GARAS21">Ka... Karu! Stop it!</Text>
	<Text label="GARAS22">Ka, Karu~~~~!!!!!</Text>
	<Text label="KOTIA23">He&apos;s not dead yet. We should be able to save him if we take him quickly to the hospital.</Text>
	<Text label="GARAS24">Kotia...</Text>
	<Text label="KOTIA25">Actually, I already reported about you to Commander Keyhawk.</Text>
	<Text label="GARAS26">What?</Text>
	<Text label="KOTIA27">He was angry at first, but he said he&apos;ll look the other way as long as you keep him hidden from other people.</Text>
	<Text label="GARAS28">Is... is that really true?</Text>
	<Text label="KOTIA29">Yes. So, let&apos;s go back to the unit.</Text>
	<Text label="GARAS30">Thank you, Kotia... Sniff sniff...</Text>
