	<Text label="GA00">My dear Tijeridians!</Text>
	<Text label="GA01">You are heroes who have been selected from the ranks of Tijeridian adventurers to be here today!</Text>
	<Text label="GA02">You have been summoned, so the state can award you with the qualifications of High Class officially recognized by the state.</Text>
	<Text label="SO03">But, you must also know that these qualifications cannot be handed out to just anybody.</Text>
	<Text label="GB04">Only those who pass the test run by the state will receive the qualification.</Text>
	<Text label="SO05">You will learn more about the test when you visit the Test Supervisor Gaink Shuraha in the Arena.</Text>
	<Text label="GA06">I hope each and every one of you pass the test so I can see all your faces on the day of the qualification award ceremony. End of Message!</Text>

	<Text label="thief9">Eh? ... Ohh, aren&apos;t you that youth from last time who helped catch that thief of a brat?</Text>
	<Text label="ron10">So you passed this test as well.</Text>
	<Text label="ron10_1">I knew from the first time I met you that you are no ordinary fellow.</Text>
	<Text label="ron10_2">Now that you&apos;ve become a respectable hero recognized by the state, I&apos;ll come and ask for you if there is any matter to be taken care of.</Text>
	<Text label="Urid11">Please don&apos;t be so unkind to refuse me saying that you&apos;re too busy. Hahaha!</Text>
