	<Text label="P01">An Artifact is a mysterious relic from the Tower of Eternity.</Text>
	<Text label="P02">No two are alike, but they&apos;re all immensely powerful.</Text>
	<Text label="P03">We don&apos;t understand the full extent of what an Artifact does,</Text>
	<Text label="P04">but we can tap a fraction of its power</Text>
	<Text label="P05">if we have the proper Activation Stone.</Text>
	<Text label="P06">Each Artifact is a devastating weapon in the right hands:</Text>
	<Text label="P07">Some can slaughter every enemy within sight,</Text>
	<Text label="P08">and others can bring troops back from the brink of death.</Text>
	<Text label="P09">Artifacts can turn defeat to victory--or vice versa--</Text>
	<Text label="P10">so capturing Artifacts is imperative.</Text>
	<Text label="P11">A powerful Protector stands watch over every Artifact;</Text>
	<Text label="P12">subdue the Protector, and the Artifact is yours.</Text>
