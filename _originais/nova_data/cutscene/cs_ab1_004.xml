	<Text label="P01">The castle gates are the first line of defense for the fortress.</Text>
	<Text label="P02">They can withstand most attacks, and the Gate Guardian Stone can repair the gates,</Text>
	<Text label="P03">so the fortress defenders can hold out a long time indeed.</Text>
	<Text label="P04">But the Gate Guardian Stone only does its job</Text>
	<Text label="P05">when you&apos;re using the Gate Restoration Stone.</Text>
	<Text label="P06">If attackers deactivate the Restoration Stone,</Text>
	<Text label="P07">they can destroy the castle gates in a flash.</Text>
	<Text label="P08">Also, siege weapons can overwhelm even the strongest gate,</Text>
	<Text label="P09">so destroy enemy siege weapons whenever you can.</Text>
