	<Text label="URI00">Ah, you are here, [%username]. I have yet another matter that I wish you could take care of.</Text>
	<Text label="KALLA01">Maintaining the secrecy in this mission is critical, more so than any other previous tasks.</Text>
	<Text label="URI02">We have intelligence that there is a plot of assassinating the soldiers of the Elysean Army. I find it difficult to believe, but the culprit seems to be an insider of the Blood Sky Knights.</Text>
	<Text label="URI03">[Keydion Bode], an intelligence staff officer of the Blood Sky Knights who you might know as well, is one of the prime suspects.</Text>
	<Text label="KALLA04">Did he ever display any suspicious behavior, by any chance?</Text>
	<Text label="SOL05">Anyway... He did look quite startled when he saw a note.</Text>
	<Text label="URI06">Yes, he must&apos;ve caught the scent and went into hiding. But, we&apos;ve already located where he&apos;s hiding.</Text>
	<Text label="KALLA07">It seems that he&apos;s hiding somewhere in the ruined [Barat Manor], located in the [Barat Subterranean Heat Area].</Text>
	<Text label="URI08">He is very quick, no surprise as he is on the intelligence staff of the Blood Sky Knights. He would sense it and flee immediately if the army moved in.</Text>
	<Text label="URI09">But if someone like you who is not a soldier approaches him and acts as if you are of the same mind with that traitor, he might just fall for it, too.</Text>
	<Text label="SOL10">Are you saying I should dispose of him myself...?</Text>
	<Text label="URI11">That would be nice too, but as there are things to verify with that traitor we&apos;d prefer it if you could lure him out alive.</Text>
	<Text label="KALLA12">There is a huge [Cellar] under that Barat Manor. Let&apos;s make a use of it.</Text>
	<Text label="URI13">As we don&apos;t know who in the Blood Sky Knights is an ally or a foe, make sure to keep this to yourself only.</Text>
	<Text label="KALLA14">We forged a letter based on the information we obtained on the rebel forces. You just need to show this to Keydion Bode.</Text>
	<Text label="URI15">If the wretch appears at the location written on this letter, he is basically exposing his involvement in this plot himself.</Text>
	<Text label="SOL16">Isn&apos;t this mark...?</Text>
	<Text label="URI17">Yes. It looks as if though the [Holy Knights of the Tower of Light] is behind them. Please be careful.</Text>
	<Text label="KALLA18">We&apos;ll leave early and sneak into the place with some soldiers. We put our faith in you.</Text>
