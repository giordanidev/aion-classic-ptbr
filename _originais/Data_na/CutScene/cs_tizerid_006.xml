	<Text label="URI00">You came, [%username]. It&apos;s been a while.</Text>
	<Text label="URI01">I have summoned you to personally ask you to do something for me.</Text>
	<Text label="SOL02">......?</Text>
	<Text label="URI03">Haha, you look quite startled to be hearing this as soon as we meet.</Text>
	<Text label="URI04">I&apos;ve been watching you, and it led me to believe that I can rely on you to take care of something quietly without moving the army.</Text>
	<Text label="URI05">My adjutant Kallaine will give you a briefing of the mission.</Text>
	<Text label="CALLA06">We have intelligence that the Tursin Krall have started building a large number of siege weapons. Simply put, they are like the catapults of the Elyos.</Text>
	<Text label="URI07">It means that those wretched Krall are preparing to come at us once more.</Text>
	<Text label="URI08">Hand-to-hand combats aren&apos;t a problem as long as we Blood Sky Knights and the dauntless Red Flame Brigade are around, but the siege weapons could be quite annoying, you know.</Text>
	<Text label="URI09">So I want you to go where the catapults are, and have them neutralized.</Text>
	<Text label="SO10">By myself?</Text>
	<Text label="URI11">Haha, don&apos;t be so concerned as I have already thought up a plan.</Text>
	<Text label="CALLA12">When you go to the magic store in [Tijerid Leftwing Port], you will find someone called [Drenon Mines].</Text>
	<Text label="CALLA13">She is the best magical chemist in Tijerid. And she will give you something good for neutralizing the Krall&apos;s catapults.</Text>
	<Text label="URI14">And once you received the item from Drenon, go to the [Wilderness of Roar] and meet a fellow called [Berden J Micks].</Text>
	<Text label="URI15">He will tell you in detail of what to do next.</Text>
	<Text label="SOL16">I understand.</Text>
	<Text label="URI17">I wish you good luck, then.</Text>
	<Text label="URI18">You&apos;ve neutralized all the catapults? Really well done! I knew I had the right person to do it.</Text>
	<Text label="URI19">Unfortunately, although you have just returned I must tell you that I have another task for you to do.</Text>
	<Text label="CALLA20A">We have information that the most of the Krall&apos;s siege weapons are being constructed by the [Goblin Engineers] under their command.</Text>
	<Text label="CALLA20B">So just neutralizing those catapults is useless unless you also get rid of those Goblins. Since they will continue to build them again, you see.</Text>
	<Text label="URI21">We received reports that those Goblin Engineers are operating near those catapults.</Text>
	<Text label="CALLA22">Apparently you can find the habitat of the Goblin Engineers in an empty lot near the area where the catapults were.</Text>
	<Text label="CALLA23">We have yet to identify how many of them are there, but you just need to capture and return with one of them.</Text>
	<Text label="URI24">And if we moved the army for this mission, even the stupid Krall will become aware of what&apos;s happening and relocate those Goblin Engineers.</Text>
	<Text label="URI25">Once you bring one back we&apos;ll interrogate it to find out about the level of technology and other information regarding those siege weapons, and move the army to uproot them once and for all.</Text>
	<Text label="CALLA26">Capturing one would be difficult by yourself. So if you manage to lure one out, then the Red Flame Brigade will take care of the rest.</Text>
	<Text label="URI27">Once again, [Berden J Micks] will give you more details of the mission.</Text>
	<Text label="URI28">If you can take care of this as well, I&apos;ll give you an ample reward that you won&apos;t find lacking.</Text>
	<Text label="SOL29">I&apos;ll do my best.</Text>
	<Text label="URI30">I will leave it all to you.</Text>
	<Text label="URI31">I&apos;ve already heard about the mission regarding the Goblin Engineers from a messenger. You have done an excellent job this time, too.</Text>
	<Text label="CALLA32">For the successful completion of this mission, Lord Jurid has issued a generous reward. We will look forward to working with you in the future, as well.</Text>
	<Text label="URI33">Anyway, it seems they have begun to stir...</Text>
	<Text label="CALLA34">I&apos;ve already made the arrangements. They seem to be hiding somewhere in the [Barat Subterranean Heat Area].</Text>
	<Text label="URI35">I guess it&apos;s the [Tower of Light] who is behind them? The [Holy Knights] must&apos;ve caught a whiff of it.</Text>
	<Text label="CALLA36">We must move quickly, my lord. As soon as we locate the whereabouts of that man...</Text>
	<Text label="URI37">Will we able to handle it quietly?</Text>
	<Text label="CALLA38">How about entrusting it to [%username]?</Text>
	<Text label="URI39">Yes, and it won&apos;t raise any suspicion as that one isn&apos;t even a member of the Blood Sky Knights.</Text>
	<Text label="URI40">By the way, that item from Juhdenil will definitely work, eh?</Text>
	<Text label="URI41">We&apos;ve already completed the tests. The results were astounding, my lord. Hehehe...</Text>
