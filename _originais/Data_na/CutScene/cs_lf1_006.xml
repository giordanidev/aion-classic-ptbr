	<Text label="P01">Thank you, young Daeva, for making me whole again.</Text>
	<Text label="P02">I am Niobus, Priest of the Zumion Shrine.</Text>
	<Text label="P03">It has been a thousand years since Mesramtaeda cursed me to spend eternity as a statue.</Text>
	<Text label="P04">And in those years, my shrine has been reduced to dust and broken stone....</Text>
	<Text label="P05">But where you see ruins, my eyes see the glory that was!</Text>
	<Text label="P06">And I am still its priest.</Text>
	<Text label="P07">Thank you, Daeva of Destiny.</Text>
	<Text label="P08">May my blessing grant you strength and courage.</Text>
