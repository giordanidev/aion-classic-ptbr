	<Text label="VELUS00">Oh, are you [%username]?</Text>
	<Text label="SOL01">Yes, I am...</Text>
	<Text label="VELUS02">I am Belus Asylvade. I am the headmaster of the Tijerid Military Academy, and also an advisor of Lord Mikael Rheal.</Text>
	<Text label="VELUS03">I&apos;ve already heard about you from the intelligence staff officer. You have accomplished much.</Text>
	<Text label="VELUS04">It&apos;s shame, but Lord Mikael is under treatment now so he is unable to see you...</Text>
	<Text label="VELUS05">But he has insisted me to give you a reward.</Text>
	<Text label="VELUS06">I&apos;ve already spoke to Tellia, the knight standing in front of the door, so make sure you receive it.</Text>
	<Text label="SOL07">Thank you.</Text>
	<Text label="VELUS08">And... Regrettably, I do not know where Jurid has disappeared to.</Text>
	<Text label="VELUS09">If you ever come across rumors of his whereabouts or him, please let me know.</Text>
	<Text label="SOL10">Yes, I see.</Text>
	<Text label="VELUS11">...And, I guess you must be aware as well, but as the reputation of Tijerid is at stake... Please don&apos;t speak of this matter to anyone else.</Text>
	<Text label="SOL12">Of course, I&apos;ll keep that in mind.</Text>
