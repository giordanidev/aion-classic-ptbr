		<question>Campaign Quests and Quests</question>
		<answer>Tasks in Aion are divided into Campaign quests and Quests. Campaign quests are exciting, large scale events that could alter the destiny of Atreia and the character alike, while Quests are mostly about small incidents which are generally limited to a particular locale. Some Campaign Quests are given automatically when you enter a certain area or reach a certain level. Normally, Campaign Quests in an area are given all at once, but some require the completion of other quests before they can be started. Quests are obtained by talking to NPCs, and the difficulty and rewards could vary radically depending on the nature of the quest. &#xD;&#xA;</answer>

		<question>Sub-Class Selection</question>
		<answer>Sub-class selection in Aion occurs by completing a particular quest, which is given automatically, and appears on the Quest window when your character reaches level 9. Part of this quest will be choosing between two sub-classes available to your basic character class, allowing your character to become more specialized. Consider this choice carefully, as you cannot change your class once it is chosen.&#xD;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;</answer>
