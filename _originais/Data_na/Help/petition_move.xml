		<question>Character Stuck</question>
		<answer>Normal playing is impossible because the character is trapped in a specific area and cannot move, or the character is moved to the same coordinate repeatedly (rubber-banding). Try returning to the obelisk using the Return skill, or press &lt;Space Bar&gt; to jump. If jumping or using the Return skill does not solve the problem, press the Write Petition button below to write a petition and submit using the Submit Petition button.</answer>
