	<Text label="GA01">Grab him!</Text>
	<Text label="GA02">Hey, you! Did you see a guy running in this direction?</Text>
	<Text label="SO03">Sorry? What? Hmm, dunno...</Text>
	<Text label="GB04">Help me look for him!</Text>
	<Text label="SO05">Why me?</Text>
	<Text label="GA06">The guy was trying to steal stuff from Captain Yurid Jeridis!</Text>
	<Text label="GB07">If you&apos;re from Tijerid, you have to help us. Now get searching!</Text>
	<Text label="SO8">(Bah, there&apos;s nothing that can be done...)</Text>
	<Text label="thief9">Caught red-handed!</Text>
	<Text label="ron10">I knew you&apos;d be in there. Come out!</Text>
	<Text label="ron10_1">Don&apos;t even think about trying to escape again. Good work gents!</Text>
	<Text label="ron10_2">Who are you and why are you bothering me? Move aside!</Text>
	<Text label="Urid11">Wretch! So that&apos;s where you were!</Text>
	<Text label="thief12">Ugh!</Text>
	<Text label="GA12_1">Commander Yurid!</Text>
	<Text label="ron13">You insolent folk!</Text>
	<Text label="Urid14">You&apos;ve got some nerve, trying to steal my things here in Tijerid!</Text>
	<Text label="Urid15">Throw this wretch in jail right away! I&apos;ll question him later.</Text>
	<Text label="GA16">Yes sir!</Text>
	<Text label="Urid17">And who exactly are you? You don&apos;t appear to be a member of the Red Flame Squad. You look more like an adventurer.</Text>
	<Text label="SO18">My name is [%username].</Text>
	<Text label="Urid19">Thank you. With your help we were able to catch the thief.</Text>
	<Text label="Urid20">I will remember your name. Perhaps we&apos;ll meet again some day.</Text>
