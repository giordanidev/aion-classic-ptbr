	<Text label="Realh00">It&apos;s been a while since we last visited this hunting ground. It was a good decision to come here, big brother.</Text>
	<Text label="URID01">That&apos;s nice, Rheal. But I&apos;m not feeling too well, so I&apos;ll need to go back to the castle early.</Text>
	<Text label="Realh02">You really must be ill! Normally we can&apos;t drag you away from the hunt.</Text>
	<Text label="KALLA03">My lord has been working hard lately, constantly battling the Krall. I&apos;ll accompany him to the castle, my lord.</Text>
	<Text label="Realh04">You do that, Kallaine. then, big brother, with your leave I&apos;ll have some fun by myself today.</Text>
	<Text label="URID05">Yes... Don&apos;t overexert yourself, and return home early.</Text>
	<Text label="KALLA06">Hahaha, &quot;don&apos;t overexert yourself&quot;... Your acting is top-notch, my lord. But I don&apos;t think it will be enough to face the Trolls no matter how much he overexerts himself...?</Text>
	<Text label="BODE07">Do not underestimate Rheal. Even a pack of drugged, berserk Trolls will not find Mikael, a soldier of the Tijerid Elysean Army, such easy prey.</Text>
	<Text label="KALLA08">And why do you think I also put something in the meals of Mikael and his men, my lord?</Text>
	<Text label="URID09">... You are a wily old fox, indeed. You always think of everything, don&apos;t you.</Text>
	<Text label="KALLA10">Hehe, I will take that as a compliment, my lord.</Text>
	<Text label="GUARD11">Argghhh!</Text>
	<Text label="GUARD12">Ugh!</Text>
	<Text label="Realh13">What is going on? What are these monstrous Trolls...!</Text>
