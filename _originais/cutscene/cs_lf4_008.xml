	<Text label="P01">A strong Balaur bulwark blocks the way to Tiamaranta.</Text>
	<Text label="P02">Our forces can&apos;t advance further.</Text>
	<Text label="P03">So I was looking for a way to detour the bulwark</Text>
	<Text label="P04">and found a secret passage called the Silentera Canyon.</Text>
	<Text label="P05">I also found out that it is connected all the way to Gelkmaros where Asmodians advanced.</Text>
	<Text label="P06">The Silentera Canyon opens only when the two Balaur temples</Text>
	<Text label="P07">in Angrief Crater and Hanarkand Plain are captured.</Text>
	<Text label="P08">If we go to Gelkmaros through the passage and suppress Asmodians,</Text>
	<Text label="P09">we will deal with Tiamat more easily.</Text>
	<Text label="P10">But through the passage, Asmodians</Text>
	<Text label="P11">might capture the Balaur fortress in Inggison. So we&apos;ve got to be careful.</Text>
	<Text label="P12">Of course, Agent Herenas will do something when that happens.</Text>
