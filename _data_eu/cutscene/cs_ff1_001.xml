	<Text label="BODE0">That was dangerous. You should be grateful that I arrived in time to rescue you.</Text>
	<Text label="SOL00">Thank you very much.</Text>
	<Text label="BODE01">My family&apos;s archery skills are second to none.</Text>
	<Text label="SOL02">Yes, you are uniquely skilled in battle. But who are you...?</Text>
	<Text label="BODE03">Oh, I forgot to introduce myself. I&apos;m Keidian, the Knight&apos;s Staff Officer.</Text>
	<Text label="BODE04">Yurid sent me to protect you. I&apos;m late because I was held up on the way here.</Text>

	<Text label="BODE13">Have you shown this to anyone else?</Text>
	<Text label="SOL14">No, not a soul. But...</Text>
	<Text label="BODE15">I&apos;ve gotta get back. Forget that you ever saw this letter, and that you showed it to me.</Text>
	<Text label="SOL16">...</Text>
	<Text label="BODE17">I&apos;m telling you this in your own best interest. Well...</Text>
