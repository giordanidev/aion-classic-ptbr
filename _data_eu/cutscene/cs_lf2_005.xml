	<Text label="P02">If there&apos;s anything you may need, just say the word, Daeva.</Text>
	<Text label="P03">I know everything you&apos;ve done, Hippolytus.</Text>
	<Text label="P04">I know you murdered Philipemos</Text>
	<Text label="P05">and destroyed the Life Stone!</Text>
	<Text label="P06">It wasn&apos;t me who killed him.</Text>
	<Text label="P07">I&apos;m only what I appear to be--</Text>
	<Text label="P08">a man of business.</Text>
	<Text label="P09">It will not help you to deny it.</Text>
	<Text label="P10">Philipemos wrote down everything in his diary,</Text>
	<Text label="P11">and Actaeon has the missing pages.</Text>
	<Text label="P12">Face your punishment in the name of the Five.</Text>
	<Text label="P13">Ha-ha-ha! Perhaps you&apos;re a Shadow, too. Well, I&apos;m not afraid of you, Shadow!</Text>
