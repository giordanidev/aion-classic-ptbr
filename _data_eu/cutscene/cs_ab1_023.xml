	<Text label="P01">The Aetheric Field that surrounds the fortress is vital to its defence</Text>
	<Text label="P02">because it can render the attackers irrelevant.</Text>
	<Text label="P03">The Field will decimate enemies who try to force their way through it,</Text>
	<Text label="P04">so unless the attackers have overwhelming numbers</Text>
	<Text label="P05">and can sustain heavy casualties,</Text>
	<Text label="P06">they won&apos;t attack the fortress from the sky.</Text>
	<Text label="P07">But it is possible to shut down the Aetheric Field</Text>
	<Text label="P08">by destroying the generator inside the fortress.</Text>
	<Text label="P09">Take out the Aetheric Field Generator,</Text>
	<Text label="P10">and the attackers can assault the fortress.</Text>
