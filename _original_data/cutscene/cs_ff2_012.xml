	<Text label="GARAS00">Kotia! I came to fetch food again today.</Text>
	<Text label="KOTIA01">Yes, take this. But how long can this keep going on?</Text>
	<Text label="GARAS02">Sorry, if I&apos;m causing you concern. But there&apos;s no other way.</Text>
	<Text label="KOTIA03">...</Text>
	<Text label="GARAS04">So, until we meet again. Thanks.</Text>
	<Text label="GARAS05">Karu! Have you been waiting long? You must be starving... Eat!</Text>
	<Text label="GARAS06">Poor mite. He lost his parents, just like me...</Text>
	<Text label="GARAS07">Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;ll always protect you...</Text>
	<Text label="GARAS08">Who are you?! Have you come to take me prisoner?</Text>
	<Text label="SOL09">What is your little friend called?</Text>
	<Text label="GARAS10">He&apos;s called Karu. He&apos;s an orphan just like you. That&apos;s why I&apos;m looking after him.</Text>
	<Text label="KOTIA11">Garis... Just give up!</Text>
	<Text label="GARAS12">The lad will starve to death if I leave him. And I can&apos;t take him into the company with me...</Text>
	<Text label="GARAS13">I have to protect him!</Text>
	<Text label="KOTIA14">But you can&apos;t keep running away from it, can you? Think about your future!</Text>
	<Text label="GARAS15">It&apos;s probably too late anyway. Even if I turn back now...</Text>
	<Text label="KOTIA16">To be honest I&apos;ve already confessed everything to the Company Manager.</Text>
	<Text label="GARAS17">......!?</Text>
	<Text label="KOTIA18">He was pretty mad at first. But he said he&apos;d turn a blind eye as long as I don&apos;t draw attention to myself.</Text>
	<Text label="GARAS19">Are you serious?</Text>
	<Text label="KOTIA20">Yes. Then let&apos;s get back to the company quickly.</Text>
	<Text label="GARAS20A">Thanks, Kotia...</Text>
	<Text label="GARAS21">Karu! Stop it!</Text>
	<Text label="GARAS22">Karu!</Text>
	<Text label="KOTIA23">He&apos;s not dead yet. We can still save him if we get him to the sick bay as quickly as possible.</Text>
	<Text label="GARAS24">Kotia...</Text>
	<Text label="KOTIA25">To be honest, I&apos;ve already confessed everything to the Company Manager Kihok.</Text>
	<Text label="GARAS26">What?</Text>
	<Text label="KOTIA27">He was pretty mad at first. But he said he&apos;d turn a blind eye as long as I don&apos;t draw attention to myself.</Text>
	<Text label="GARAS28">Are you serious?</Text>
	<Text label="KOTIA29">Yes. Then let&apos;s get back to the company quickly.</Text>
	<Text label="GARAS30">Thanks, Kotia...</Text>
