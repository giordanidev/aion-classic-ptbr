	<Text label="P01">The castle gates are a fortress&apos;s first line of defense.</Text>
	<Text label="P02">They are strong enough to withstand most attacks,</Text>
	<Text label="P03">and if the defenders repair the gates with the Gate Guardian Stone, they can withstand a siege forever.</Text>
	<Text label="P04">The Gate Guardian Stone repairs the gates</Text>
	<Text label="P05">only when the defenders are using the Gate Restoration Stone.</Text>
	<Text label="P06">So if the attackers can deactivate the Restoration Stone,</Text>
	<Text label="P07">the castle gates will collapse instantly.</Text>
	<Text label="P08">Siege weapons can also obliterate castle gates,</Text>
	<Text label="P09">so destroying enemy siege weapons is our top priority.</Text>
