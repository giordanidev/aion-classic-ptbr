	<Text label="P01">Thank you, Daeva.</Text>
	<Text label="P02">Now I can return to the flow of Aether.</Text>
	<Text label="P03">But first I have a favor to beg of you.</Text>
	<Text label="P04">Please forgive my beloved Bollvig, and help him return once more to Asmodae.</Text>
	<Text label="P05">I&apos;m sorry, but that&apos;s not going to happen.</Text>
	<Text label="P06">Bollvig isn&apos;t going to be swayed by my words,</Text>
	<Text label="P07">and besides, Elysea has suffered too much at his hands.</Text>
	<Text label="P08">The brigade generals of all the Elyos fortresses, even the admiral of Blue Fleet....</Text>
	<Text label="P09">Everyone is hunting him.</Text>
	<Text label="P10">If he is guilty of anything,</Text>
	<Text label="P11">it is of loving me more than his own life.</Text>
	<Text label="P12">This would never have happened if my life had not been taken from me so unjustly.</Text>
	<Text label="P13">Oh, why did Bollvig and I ever meet?</Text>
	<Text label="P14">I curse the Empyrean Lords!</Text>
	<Text label="P15">
