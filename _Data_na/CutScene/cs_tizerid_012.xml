	<Text label="SOL02">I have something to ask about Tursin Krall...</Text>
	<Text label="TERI03">Tursin Krall, friends.</Text>
	<Text label="SOL04">Is that right... Where is the head of those Tursin Krall?</Text>
	<Text label="TERI05">Gaphyr, don&apos;t betray friends.</Text>
	<Text label="SOL06">Hm... Then will you tell me if I do something for you in return?</Text>

	<Text label="SOL08">I am sorry, but I can&apos;t set you free.</Text>
	<Text label="TERI09">Then I talk, if you give this to my brother.</Text>
