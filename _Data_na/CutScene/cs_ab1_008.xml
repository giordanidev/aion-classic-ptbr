	<Text label="P01">The Asmodians are dangerous, but the biggest threat in the Abyss are the Balaur.</Text>
	<Text label="P02">And the Balaur battleship called a Dredgion is the most fearsome of them all.</Text>
	<Text label="P03">We don&apos;t know where Dredgions come from, where they go,</Text>
	<Text label="P04">or even what path they follow through the Abyss.</Text>
	<Text label="P05">They can appear anywhere, anytime.</Text>
	<Text label="P06">When a Dredgion appears, it drops a horde of Drakans,</Text>
	<Text label="P07">then bombards the ground with a barrage of devastation.</Text>
	<Text label="P08">We have yet to discover a weakness in its potent defenses.</Text>
	<Text label="P09">So for now, whenever a Dredgion appears, we take cover.</Text>
