	<Text label="BODE0">That was close. I&apos;ll have you know that it is all thanks to I, [Keydion], who came to save you.</Text>
	<Text label="SOL00">Thank you.</Text>
	<Text label="BODE01">The [Bode] family&apos;s mastery of archery is simply incomparable, you know, haha.</Text>
	<Text label="SOL02">Yes, it really was fantastic. But... who are you?</Text>
	<Text label="BODE03">Oh, I apologize for my belated introduction. I am an intelligence staff officer of the Blood Sky Knights, [Keydion Bode.</Text>
	<Text label="BODE04">Lord Jurid has ordered me to cover you, but I was delayed by another matter that required my attention.</Text>
	<Text label="BODE05">If I was delayed just a little longer, I could&apos;ve been in big trouble with Lord Jurid.</Text>
	<Text label="SOL06">Keydion Bode... I think I heard that name from somewhere...</Text>
	<Text label="BODE07">Really? Wahaha, I&apos;m somewhat famous in Tijerid, to tell you the truth. This is slightly embarrassing.</Text>
	<Text label="SOL08">Oh, it&apos;s not that...</Text>
	<Text label="BODE09">Huh?</Text>
	<Text label="SOL10">I happened to come across a letter, and that had your name written on it.</Text>
	<Text label="BODE11">Is that right? Why don&apos;t you show it to me?</Text>
	<Text label="BODE12">Oh no...no...</Text>
	<Text label="BODE13">Have ever you shown this to anyone else?</Text>
	<Text label="SOL14">No I haven&apos;t, but...</Text>
	<Text label="BODE15">I must leave now to take care of an urgent business. And forget everything about this letter. Even that you gave it to me.</Text>
	<Text label="SOL16">. . . . . .</Text>
	<Text label="BODE17">It is all for your own good. I&apos;ll take my leave now.</Text>
