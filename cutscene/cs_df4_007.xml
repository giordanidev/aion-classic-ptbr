	<Text label="P01">In the Vagabatam Battlefield</Text>
	<Text label="P02">I found two fortresses that looked like Balaur temples.</Text>
	<Text label="P03">Recently, I also found out that they</Text>
	<Text label="P04">control the underground passage called the Silentera Canyon.</Text>
	<Text label="P05">As suggested by various sources of information, I guess the Silentera Canyon is connected to Inggison.</Text>
	<Text label="P06">So we should capture all the Balaur fortresses and open the door of the corridor.</Text>
	<Text label="P07">If we capture all the Balaur fortresses in Inggison through the corridor,</Text>
	<Text label="P08">we might be able to drive the Elyos away from Balaurea.</Text>
	<Text label="P09">But if we lose the two Balaur fortresses in Gelkmaros to the Elyos,</Text>
	<Text label="P10">we will be in danger so we&apos;ve got to be careful.</Text>
	<Text label="P11">No worries though because Agent Mastarius will take care of it if it happens.</Text>
