	<Text label="KEIDIAN00">OK, I think we ought to be safe here.</Text>
	<Text label="REAL01">Thank you. Something awful would have happened if you hadn&apos;t been here.</Text>
	<Text label="KEIDIAN02">But Mikael Reol, there&apos;s something I need to tell you.</Text>
	<Text label="REAL03">What?</Text>
	<Text label="KEIDIAN04">It&apos;s no coincidence that you were attacked by a troll.</Text>
	<Text label="REAL05">Are you saying the troll was specifically targeting me?</Text>
	<Text label="KEIDIAN06">Yes indeed. And the whole thing was instigated by Yurid Jeridis.</Text>
	<Text label="REAL07">My big brother?</Text>
	<Text label="KEIDIAN08">Yes indeed. [%username] and I were nearly killed by him, but we managed to escape at the last minute.</Text>
	<Text label="REAL09">My brother? I don&apos;t believe it.</Text>
	<Text label="KEIDIAN10">Just think about it - why did they retreat first in the hunting area?</Text>
	<Text label="REAL11A">That cannot be. My brother isn&apos;t doing so well...</Text>
	<Text label="REAL11B">Seriously?!</Text>
	<Text label="KEIDIAN12">It was all planned. I followed a trail from Yudeniel which confirms that the drug has been flowing into Tijerid.</Text>
	<Text label="KEIDIAN13">While I was following this trail, one of our scouts saw this drug being delivered to Yurid.</Text>
	<Text label="KEIDIAN14">Our scout was captured but he did manage to get a message to us.</Text>
	<Text label="REAL15">A drug?</Text>
	<Text label="KEIDIAN16">The exact ingredients remain a mystery. But one thing is certain. The monsters who take this drug grow much stronger and become extremely brutal.</Text>
	<Text label="REAL17">I can&apos;t believe something like that exists... Ugh! My body...</Text>
	<Text label="KEIDIAN18">Reol!</Text>
	<Text label="KEIDIAN19">[%username], return to the castle with Reol immediately!</Text>
