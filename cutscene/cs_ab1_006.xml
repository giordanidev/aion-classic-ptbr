	<Text label="P01">An Artefact is a relic from the Tower of Eternity.</Text>
	<Text label="P02">Each Artefact possesses a different power,</Text>
	<Text label="P03">and no one knows exactly how much each Artefact can do.</Text>
	<Text label="P04">So far, we can tap only a fraction of their power.</Text>
	<Text label="P05">To activate the Artefact, you need an Activation Stone.</Text>
	<Text label="P06">We have discovered several kinds of Artefacts:</Text>
	<Text label="P07">some can obliterate a multitude of enemies,</Text>
	<Text label="P08">while others heal your allies&apos; wounds.</Text>
	<Text label="P09">Because these weapons can reverse the tide of battle instantly,</Text>
	<Text label="P10">it is crucial to capture as many Artefacts as possible.</Text>
	<Text label="P11">A powerful Protector guards each artefact,</Text>
	<Text label="P12">so to seize its power, you must first subdue the Protector.</Text>
