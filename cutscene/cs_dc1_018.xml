	<Text label="P02">Well...they killed Hellion and survived, if that tells you anything.</Text>
	<Text label="P03">And the Shadow Judges?</Text>
	<Text label="P04">All the Judges who went to Ataxiar are dead. Vanished.</Text>
	<Text label="P05">By...Him?</Text>
	<Text label="P06">Yes. Or so I believe, at any rate.</Text>
	<Text label="P07">So He has finally stirred.</Text>
	<Text label="P08">Yes. It&apos;s too soon to be sure, but yes.</Text>
	<Text label="P09">I can&apos;t make my move until I know exactly what He is after...</Text>
	<Text label="P10">And what of Marchutan?</Text>
	<Text label="P11">Marchutan succeeded in driving Tiamat into a corner,</Text>
	<Text label="P12">but then Empyrean Lord Kaisinel got involved.</Text>

	<Text label="P15">Still, it is Marchutan, and he&apos;s not likely to go down without a fight, either.</Text>
	<Text label="P16">Prepare to send reinforcements, just in case.</Text>
	<Text label="P17">Yes....</Text>
