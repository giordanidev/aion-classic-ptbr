	<Text label="VELUS00">Ah, are you [%username]?</Text>
	<Text label="SOL01">Yes indeed.</Text>
	<Text label="VELUS02">They call me Bellus Achibald. I am the director of the Tijerid Military Academy and adviser to Mikael Reol.</Text>
	<Text label="VELUS03">My Information Officers have already told me about you. You&apos;ve done a great job.</Text>
	<Text label="VELUS04">Sadly, Mikael is currently on a retreat and is unable to welcome you in person...</Text>
	<Text label="VELUS05">But he expressly ordered that you should be rewarded.</Text>
	<Text label="VELUS06">I have already asked Knight Teila to take care of this. He will be waiting outside for you.</Text>
	<Text label="SOL07">Thank you very much.</Text>
	<Text label="VELUS08">One more thing... It&apos;s deeply irritating that nobody knows where Yurid has fled to.</Text>
	<Text label="VELUS09">Please let me know if you find out where he is, or if you hear any news about him.</Text>
	<Text label="SOL10">OK, will do.</Text>
	<Text label="VELUS11">As you know, Tijerid&apos;s reputation is at stake. For this reason, I ask you never to speak of this issue.</Text>
	<Text label="SOL12">I&apos;ll remember that.</Text>
